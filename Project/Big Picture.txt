Structure: Windows Forms application & Class library.
(Take into account future porting to other applications)

Data: SQL / Text file.

Users: One at a time on application (not real-time)
	> Something like a refresh-button that can be clicked to see if there are any updates to the provided data.



Key Concepts:
E-mail: How does the system e-mail (and how can you do that with C#?)

SQL: How to do SQL with C#?

Custom events: When a game is completed, the tournaments is over etc., we need the system to respond and fire off an event.

Error handling: Need error handling to give better info so I know what goes wrong and the system can continue running despite errors.

Interfaces: Passing information from form to form is best done through interfaces.

Random ordering: On various occasions the system needs to randomize information (bracket, 'byes') etc.

Bonus
Texting: Instead of an e-mail, perhaps some tournament members would prefer receiving a text instead?
